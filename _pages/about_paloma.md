I am a PhD researcher in Natural Language Processing at the IRLab, University of A Coruña, Spain, where I explore how large language models (LLMs) perceive, assess, and sometimes reproduce hate speech on social media. I am intrigued by the ways AI can both reflect and amplify societal biases, and by how we can make models more responsible, fair, and understandable.

My research interests revolve around hate speech and abusive language detection, with a focus on making NLP systems responsible, fair, and explainable. I am particularly interested in how large language models behave across languages and communities, and in understanding the social and sociolinguistic dimensions of online discourse. I also explore low-resource and multilingual NLP, data-centric approaches, and the design of tools and datasets that help evaluate and improve AI systems in detecting and mitigating online hate.

I maintain open-source implementations of my work and related experiments on [GitHub](https://github.com/palomapiot). You can also follow my academic and professional updates on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paloma-piot/) and [X](https://x.com/itspalomap).
