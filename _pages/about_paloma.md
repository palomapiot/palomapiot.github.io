I am a PhD researcher in Natural Language Processing working on hate speech detection and analysis in social media, with a particular emphasis on understanding how large language models behave, fail, and can be improved in this task. My research focuses on how LLMs react to hate speech, assess it, and sometimes reproduce it, as well as the implications of these behaviours for automated moderation systems.

My work spans efficient and explainable hate speech detection through model distillation, geographic and sociolinguistic bias analysis in LLMs, and data-centric approaches for low-resource settings, including the construction of meta-collections, benchmarks, and targeted datasets. I am also interested in the reliability of LLMs as annotators or evaluators, and in tooling that supports dataset expansion and analysis for combating online hate.

I maintain open-source implementations of my work and related experiments on [GitHub](https://github.com/palomapiot). You can also follow my academic and professional updates on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paloma-piot/) and [X](https://x.com/itspalomap).
